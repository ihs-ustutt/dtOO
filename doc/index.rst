Welcome to dtOO's documentation!
================================

dtOO is a scientific C++ library with a Python interface for designing
hydraulic machines. It is built based on the idea of providing a 
toolbox for geometry generation, mesh generation and simulation setup 
generation within one tool specifically dedicated to hydraulic machinery. 

A parameterized machine in dtOO can be automatically optimized within any
optimization toolbox. The framework was successfully tested for optimizing
a kinetic turbine using OpenFOAM and pygmo.

If you are using dtOO as part of your research, teaching, or other 
activities, we would be grateful if you could star the repository and/or 
cite our work. For citation purposes, you can use the following BibTex
